## #BlockWatchSG

Exercising kampung spirit - “TAKE CARE OF MY BLOCK" or #blockwatchSG initiative
1. Do what we can to lighten the load of our government. This is so that our resources remain sustainable and can be focused on those who need them the most - frontline workers, the vulnerable, etc.
2. Let’s take care of each other within our own blocks. This means a faster response time. Give a shout out should you need help with grocery runs, food, etc.
3. Lend support to those who are on SHN or Quarantine Order.
