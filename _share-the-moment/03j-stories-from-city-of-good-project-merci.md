## Project Merci

#### Welfare Pack Islandwide Distribution to Cleaners

Together with 70 volunteers, the good folk from Project Merci put together over 700 welfare packs for cleaners. They then headed out to distribute the packs at 33 hawker centres across the island to share some love with the people who keep them clean and safe for all of us. 


<sup><b><u>About</u></b><br>
Project Merci is a self-initiated youth project that aims to provide a platform for likeminded individuals, to show our appreciation to these selfless heroes. We hope to be able to spread this warm spirit with love and care from our fellow Singaporeans to these unsung heroes during this period of tough times. #sgmerci<br><br><a href="https://www.youth.gov.sg/Peek-Show/2020/2/20-year-old-initiates-project-to-show-appreciation-to-cleaners-amidst-COVID-19-outbreak?fbclid=IwAR2Z2mZBGi8ZOuTfQriNVYOSVOurA5ehMKzlVA5jGY5iNsoFUwd4O-uoras" style="color:tomato">Youth.SG</a></sup>
