## Community Partner – National Volunteer & Philanthropy Centre (NVPC)

The National Volunteer & Philanthropy Centre (NVPC ) is the steward of the City of Good vision for Singapore, where individuals, organisations and leaders come together to give their best for others. Through our brands, programmes, and initiatives, we facilitate partnerships with non-profits, organisations, public sector bodies, and individuals to enliven the giving ecosystem within Singapore. 

We invite you to join us in building a #CityofGood together. Visit us at [www.cityofgood.sg](www.cityofgood.sg).
