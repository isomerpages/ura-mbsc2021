Sodexo’s giving strategy is anchored in its Corporate Responsibility roadmap named “Better Tomorrow 2025”, where goals and targets are intricately linked to the 17 United Nation Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Supporting the community is integrated into Sodexo’s company policies and processes and has senior leadership endorsement. For example, information about Stop Hunger, Sodexo’s global non-profit network working towards a hunger-free world, is embedded in the onboarding process for new hires as well as regular communications with all employees. Employee volunteers such as members of its corporate-giving Servathon Committee are recognised by Sodexo’s Cluster President through company townhalls and Certificates of Appreciation. In 2022, Sodexo Singapore has also recently introduced ​a Volunteer Leave policy for its employees, to further encourage personal volunteering with causes their employees identify strongly with.

Sodexo continues its annual tradition of forming the Stop Hunger Servathon committee in Singapore, which brings together an ecosystem of stakeholders – employees, consumers, suppliers, and partners – to serve the local community, and reduce hunger and malnutrition. For the year ahead, the committee plans to organise employee volunteering programmes, fundraising events and meal distribution drives with its clients and employees to support Sodexo's beneficiaries. Sodexo has also formed the SoTogether committee in Singapore, a movement to promote gender equality and help women advance their careers in Sodexo.
