Andrew Ong is the co-founder of Break The Cycle, a ground-up initiative started in 2020 that supports ex-offenders in breaking the cycle of recidivism and achieve positive life goals through cycling. An ex-offender and an avid cyclist himself, Andrew was inspired by those who had invested in him and wanted to pay it forward.

Growing up, Andrew was a school dropout and a gang member. At the age of 18, he was incarcerated for 9 months for a rioting offence. Upon his release, he did not change for the better as he started abusing drugs. This continued for three years until he was imprisoned a second time, during his National Service where he served time in the detention barracks for insubordination.

Fortunately, he found his way back and rebuilt his life. He eventually completed his studies and graduated with a degree in Communications Management. Today, Andrew marries his corporate experience with his personal mission in championing the interest/needs of ex-offenders and the vulnerable at Highpoint Community Services Association (HCSA) as their Assistant Director for Partnerships. He also serves as a member of HCSA Highpoint Management Committee.

Having experienced what he went through during his youth and having to rebuild his life and relationships, he understands what it takes for ex-offenders to stay on course and rebuild their lives. It requires a strong support system, which some ex-offenders may not have. Hence the birth of Break the Cycle.
