#### Lending a Helping Hand to Migrant Workers

ItsRainingRaincoats has been arranging for thousands of meals; provision of care packs, data card top-ups and other essentials; spreading messages of encouragement and support; and sourcing for and re-distributing pre-loved laptops and handphones to migrant workers since the COVID-19 outbreak began.

They have also helped in raising funds for the families of migrant workers who lost their lives in Singapore this year as well as for migrant workers who had terminal illnesses. They also appealed for baby items for the pregnant wife of a Bangladeshi worker who had contracted COVID-19 and was in critical condition in the ICU.

<sup><b><u>About</u></b><br>
Founded in 2015, ItsRainingRaincoats is a simple initiative that aims to spread recognition and compassion towards the migrant workers of Singapore. By creating a bridge between volunteers and the migrant workers, we hope that through this initiative, potential volunteers will be able to feel an impact from the different stories of these migrant workers and how they work hard to build our Singapore. We aim to improve the lives of migrant workers in Singapore and build bridges to strengthen their integration into our broader community. We do this using imaginative, innovative, authentic and nimble strategies. Our raincoat symbolises the protection we provide them from their metaphorical thunderstorms.
