# Overview

MBSC 2022 will bring back Share the Moment, a series of light projection shows in partnership with the National Volunteer & Philanthropy Centre (NVPC) and in support of its vision for a City of Good. These light projections will feature original artworks by local students, who were inspired by the stories of this year’s President’s Volunteerism & Philanthropy Awards nominees. Their illustrations portray heartwarming moments where people have come together to give their best for others during difficult times. 

Nightly light projection shows will transform the facades of The Fullerton Hotel Singapore, the ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands and the Merlion into a storytelling showcase.
