#### $1,500 Spent to Purchase Masks for Those in Need  

Benjamin wanted to buy cotton swabs, hand sanitiser and surgical masks for his mother, who suffers from diabetes, but supplies had run out at local pharmacies. He realised that the shortage of supplies would affect many people like his mother and proceeded to spend about $1,500 of his own money to purchase 3,000 masks from overseas, so that he could distribute them to organisations that needed the supplies urgently.
