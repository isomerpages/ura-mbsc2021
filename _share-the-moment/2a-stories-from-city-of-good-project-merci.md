## Project Merci

Project Merci is a self-initiated youth project that aims to provide a platform for like minded individuals, to show our appreciation to these selfless heroes. We hope to be able to spread this warmth spirit with love and care from our fellow Singaporeans to these unsung heroes during this period of tough time. #sgmerci
