#### Supporting Elderly Friends at MacPherson

Groceries were purchased and delivered to over 30 elderly friends in the MacPherson neighbourhood, by an amazing group of volunteers. 
To support local businesses facing challenges due to COVID-19, the groceries were also purchased from the local Econ minimart!
