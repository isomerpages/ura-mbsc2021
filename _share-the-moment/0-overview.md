# Overview

A joint initiative with Community Partner, National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre (NVPC), the Share the Moment campaign is a community engagement project that showcases co-created artworks through projection mapping sequences on iconic facades in Marina Bay. 

This edition of Share the Moment features diverse experiences and stories gathered by NVPC, wherein these stories collectively paint a vision of a Singapore that cares, where individuals, organisations and leaders come together to give their best for others in a City of Good. In a collaborative effort with local schools, a dedicated group of students volunteered their time to participate in a series of masterclasses to co-create works of art inspired by these stories of good deeds. The artworks were then adapted for the projection shows that will light up the Marina Bay precinct.  
		
Through these projection shows, we hope to celebrate the selflessness and resilience of the community, and continue to nurture the spirit of giving in the year ahead.

From 25 to 31 December 2020, watch as the vision for Singapore to be a “City of Good” comes to life nightly on the facades of The Fullerton Hotel Singapore, ArtScience Museum and the Merlion. Refer to the schedule for more details.
