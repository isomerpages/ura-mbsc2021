# Overview

A joint initiative with Community Partner, National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre (NVPC), the Share the Moment campaign is a community project that culminates in projection mapping shows on the facades of three iconic landmarks in Marina Bay – The Fullerton Hotel Singapore, ArtScience Museum and the Merlion. 

This edition of Share the Moment is inspired by stories from the City of Good – a vision where individuals, organisations and leaders come together to give their best for the others. In a collaborative effort with local schools, a dedicated group of students volunteered their time to participate in a series of masterclasses to co-create works of art inspired by these stories of good. The artworks were then adapted for the projection mapping shows that will light up the Marina Bay precinct.  

From 25 to 31 December 2020, watch as the vision for Singapore to be a “City of Good” comes to life nightly on the facades of The Fullerton Hotel Singapore, ArtScience Museum and the Merlion, and celebrate moments in the past year where outstanding givers came together to uplift others in the community.
