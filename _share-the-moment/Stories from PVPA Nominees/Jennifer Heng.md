## Jennifer Heng

When Jennifer Heng, Founder and Director of Safe Place, became pregnant as a teenager, she experienced immense fear and loneliness. She bore the painful consequences of abortion for many years, and only found hope and healing much later in her life through her faith, family and loved ones. A question that she asked frequently was, “What help can I give to other women who may be in a similar situation as I was?”

With a passion to empower others, she started Safe Place in February 2018. Safe Place aims to empower unsupported pregnant mothers and their families to make life-giving choices. Staff and volunteers from all walks of life form a loving community for these mothers who may be distressed by financial worries, broken relationships, and health issues. Practical support like casework and counselling, baby essentials, parentcraft skills and even temporary accommodation are provided free-of-charge, for as long as needed. Together, Singapore can be a safe place for vulnerable mothers and children.
