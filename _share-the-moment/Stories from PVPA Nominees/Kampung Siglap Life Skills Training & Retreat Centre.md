## Kampung Siglap Life Skills Training & Retreat Centre

Kampung Siglap Life Skills Training and Retreat Centre (KS) has been a vision in the making since 2017 – a bold endeavour by New Hope Community Services (NHCS).

Nestled within the tranquil Frankel estate, KS seeks to become a melting pot for a more inclusive Singapore; reigniting hope and transforming the lives of the displaced and less-advantaged. Bringing together the richness of society; passionate volunteers, talented partners, influential voices – KS stands as a bridge to empower the least amongst us.

As COVID-19 pushed our nation into great uncertainty, how much more overwhelming must it have been for the less-advantaged? The seemingly endless challenges as they attempt to navigate their way through constantly changing terrains. The partnership between J.P. Morgan and NHCS served as an invaluable resource during the pandemic and beyond. Volunteers from J.P. Morgan demonstrated what it means to stand in the gaps of society – from providing educational support for school-going children during the phases of home-based learning, to donating a few hundred computers to be distributed to various Social Service Agencies and their service-users, to senior leaders participating in skills-based volunteering to support NHCS’ strategic planning and digitalisation roadmap.

KS continues to serve as a driving force for NHCS in adhering to the ‘Many Helping Hands’ philosophy by partnering an ecosystem of stakeholders, to bring about greater and more sustainable impact for the social sector at large.
