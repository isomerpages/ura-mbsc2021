## Food from the Heart

Food from the Heart is a charity founded in February 2003 by Singapore-based Austrian couple Henry and Christine Laimer who were inspired to channel surplus food from bakeries to families in need after they read an article about bread wastage. Today, Food from the Heart is one of Singapore's foremost food charities with IPC status devoted to alleviating hunger through the efficient distribution of food in a sustainable manner and making a significant impact in food waste reduction.

With the support of partners, donors, food industry partners and more than 10,000 volunteers, Food from the Heart made a difference to the lives of 53,700 people throughout Singapore by distributing S$6.35 million worth of food in 2020.
