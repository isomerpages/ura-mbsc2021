## Pan Pacific Hotels Group

Pan Pacific Hotels Group has three broad pillars to deepen our impact on the community, weaving doing good into everything that we do. As a Champion for Inclusive Employment, we are committed to providing dignified and sustainable employment for persons with disabilities. We have employed 26 such associates across our properties, and they play a vital role in various functions, from F&B to housekeeping. In a commissioned study, we found that our inclusive hiring approach increased our teams’ compassion for others and pride for the organisation.

As a Leader in Sustainable Hospitality, we sweat the small details, working with local partners to reduce waste, energy, and water consumption – be it through eliminating single-use plastics or providing filtered water in hotel rooms, among many others.

Finally, as a Platform for the Arts, we invigorate our hotel spaces through supporting local artists and co-hosting exhibitions with them in our properties.
