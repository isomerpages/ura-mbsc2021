## Denise, Michelle and Mae

KampungKakis is a neighbourhood buddy system aimed at supporting the elderly and low-income families, by connecting volunteers with their neighbours-in-need based on proximity, assistance type and spoken language. Our goal is to reignite the kampung spirit of looking out for one another by providing a safe and inclusive platform for enduring friendships to blossom between marginalised communities and the general public.

Volunteer kakis have the flexibility and convenience of helping their matched kaki-in-need in any capacity and frequency that works best for them; just like one would do for a friend! Help can range from simply lending a listening ear, running grocery errands, to teaching seniors essential digital skills. Being in close proximity to the community also means that our volunteer kakis have become an extra pair of helping hands, ears and eyes on the ground for many of our social and case workers, who often may not have the bandwidth to attend to day-to-day or urgent needs of the beneficiaries.

KampungKakisâ€™s vision is to create a community network in Singapore that is resilient and self-sustaining, so that no one will be left behind in good times and bad. KampungKakis now supports over 600 kakis-in-need island-wide.
