## Dr. Chong Poh Heng

Amidst our highly advanced and modern healthcare system, Dr Chong Poh Heng saw a gap in the care of terminally ill children over 10 years ago. What these unfortunate children needed most was not an extended stay in the hospital, but rather, a robust and reliable service that allowed them to spend more time at home, where comfort and control were not compromised as trade-offs. He started Star PALS (Paediatric Advanced Life Support), a community specialist palliative care service that serves children with life-shortening illnesses and their families. This service is provided under Singapore’s largest home hospice care provider and charity, HCA Hospice Care. 

“No matter how briefly a shooting star lights up the night sky, its brilliant trail leaves a path of hope for all to see.” This is the inspiration behind the Star PALS logo. The 24/7 full suite service that Dr Chong brings to the home with his team of doctors, nurses, social workers, therapists and volunteers is complimentary, ensuring that no further financial stress is added, yet always maximizing the child’s comfort and minimizing caregiver burden. Their compassionate care extends beyond the death of the child to support loved ones in bereavement. These special children’s lives are not forgotten and in fact, always celebrated. Love never dies.
