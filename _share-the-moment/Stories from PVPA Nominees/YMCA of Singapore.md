## YMCA of Singapore

The YMCA of Singapore stands to champion, challenge and train youth to become independent and effective contributors to an inclusive society. We organise various sports, arts and vocational training programmes to strengthen youth with special needs, youth-at-risk, youth leaders and volunteers.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused widespread disruption to vulnerable groups who faced difficulties affording or accessing necessities. It has also affected service providers including hawkers, private hire drivers and migrant workers as they experienced a drop in job activities and income. With the support of our donors, over $518,800 was raised under Wok the Talk 2020. The YMCA was empowered to help vulnerable seniors with their grocery shopping. We also partnered with hawkers and private hire drivers to deliver packed meals to seniors, persons with special needs, less-privileged youth and migrant workers.
 
In 2019, the first-ever YMCA Inclusive Climb saw 10 persons with special needs challenge Japan's tallest mountain, Mt Fuji. It showed them and the world that persons with special needs can achieve unimaginable heights, serving as immense encouragement to others with special needs.
