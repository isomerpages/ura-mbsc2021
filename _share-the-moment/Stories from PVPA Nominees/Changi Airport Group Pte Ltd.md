## Changi Airport Group Pte Ltd

Changi Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Changi Airport Group Pte Ltd, is guided by the vision of “Connecting with youths today, empowering them for a better tomorrow”. It focuses on supporting disadvantaged youths and providing them with opportunities that help lay the groundwork for future success.

One of our partners is Metta School, a Special Education School for children and youth with Mild Intellectual Disability, some of whom have Autism. Leveraging the facilities in Changi Airport and with the support of our employees and airport partners, we complement the school’s curriculum through specially curated programmes to help the students improve their independent living skills and employability.

When COVID-19 disrupted our face-to-face CSR activities, we pivoted to virtual programmes to maintain safety, and to continue supporting our youths so that they can adapt to the new normal like everyone else. Some of the programmes included the tele-medical consultation where employee volunteers roleplay as nurses and doctors, and virtual job interviews to help the students practise for future job interviews. Looking ahead, we hope to bring back our physical job attachment programmes, and work with airport partners to explore suitable work experiences for the students.
