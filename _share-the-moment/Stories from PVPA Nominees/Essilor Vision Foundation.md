## Essilor Vision Foundation

Essilor Vision Foundation launched a three-year migrant workers vision care program to provide 300,000 migrant workers with good vision. This program started as we realized their vision needs have been blindsided, with some of them struggling with poor vision. Due to their heavy commitments and financial constraints, getting a pair of glasses is not their priority. Neglected vision is detrimental as it will negatively impact their health, productivity and safety at work. Together with Migrant Workers Centre, we hope to create sustainable vision access points and a supportive eco-system for the migrant workers who otherwise have very few options to get good vision care. 

With the ongoing pandemic, we are relying on technology to deliver these much needed vision services. Philanthropic collaborations with partners were forthcoming to help ease the pressures from the restricted measures. An example is our partnership with Institute of Systems Science from National University of Singapore, they are working on a digital interface to help mitigate and direct our migrant friends to a self-dispensing glasses vending machine. We are also grateful to Ngee Ann Polytechnic for designing the process and IELO agency for designing an awesome user experience.
