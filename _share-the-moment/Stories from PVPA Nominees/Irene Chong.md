## Irene Chong

Irene Chong grew up in a rental flat with her family eating canned food, instant noodles, or soya sauce with pickles and porridge. When she entered primary school, her classmates lived lavish lifestyles in big mansions, travelled overseas several times a year, came to school with personal chauffeurs and maids while her family survived from paycheque to paycheque and had to borrow money from relatives to make ends meet. Thus, she was determined to break free of the poverty cycle and studied hard and climbed the corporate ladder to where she is today.

Irene recognises the value of fulfilling one’s potential through grit and determination. She started out in a rental flat, and now she returns back to rental flats to inspire others. With this mission statement in life that it is more blessed to give than to receive, she began serving the community from an early age of 16 years old. She currently serves in 6 non-profit boards in various capacities. She considers it a privilege to lend her experience to spearhead fundraising activities to give back to society. “If I can do it, so can you!”, she encourages all.
