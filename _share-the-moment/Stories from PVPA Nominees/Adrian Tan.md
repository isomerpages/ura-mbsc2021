## Adrian Tan

Adrian Tan’s vision to transform and revolutionize the Singapore social services sector drove him and Greg Tan to co-found SG Assist. His inspiration was drawn from an experience very close to his heart. 

His mother suffered from depression after recovering from cancer. He experienced first-hand the disjointed social care value chain in Singapore. Now, the SG Assist platform has linked up more than 4,000 volunteers with Care Connect – a care concierge service, focused on helping seniors and people with disabilities and their caregivers to use technology in finding the best solution for their caregiving journey.
