Sharing my voice - As a young person, I think we still need the help of folks older than us to make a bigger difference in areas we care about. Everyone has a voice and somethings(s) or someone they care deeply about and to me, to care deep enough is to step forward to share your voice. 

Sharing your voice is important as doing so will help you get more people to share your ideas. Donating $1 to make sure rabbits have food is fine, sharing your voice can mean many more animals or people who need help are noticed SO they can get the help they need. In some cases, delays in getting help can cause serious problems for those in need, so if we are in a position to help - let's do it.
