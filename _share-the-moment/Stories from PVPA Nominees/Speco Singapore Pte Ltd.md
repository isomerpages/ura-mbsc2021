## Speco Singapore Pte Ltd

Speco Singapore Pte Ltd is an award-winning cleaning technology company that started as a cleaning service in 2017. Originally known as Spic & Span, Speco is also the name of the antimicrobial coating that we invented in 2019 that sanitizes and actively protects. It provides continuous protection and disinfection in a greener and safer way unlike other cleaning solutions that kill germs on a one-time basis. Speco users include Changi Airport, DBS, Singapore Airlines and Wildlife Reserves. Today, Speco is used to protect more than 300 organizations across Singapore from COVID-19 and can also be found regionally including Malaysia, Hong Kong and Philippines. 

We are also proud to be a social enterprise that provides stable jobs to marginalized Singaporeans including ex-offenders, people with disabilities and single parents. We have partnered with more than 90 social service agencies to train, upskill and employ over 300 individuals to date. We have also carried out pro bono disinfection work to improve the safety of over 64,000 elderly residents at nursing homes, as well as small and medium enterprises facing challenging times. 

As a B-corp and a social enterprise, Speco is committed to delivering on our environmental and social impact goals to protect people and provide jobs to those who need them, while maintaining a sustainable business.
