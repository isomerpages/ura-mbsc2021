## Beng Who Cares Foundation - Jason and Zhen Long

#### Meals for Those in Need, No Questions Asked 

Inspired by a friend buying food for a homeless person, Jason and Zhen Long created "Beng Who Cares Foundation", and gave away free meals to those in need during the Circuit Breaker period. As long as they came forward to ask for a meal, Beng Who Cares Foundation delivered them to those who needed it (no questions asked, no proof needed). They did this all on their own accord, and actively rejected donations.
