## The Simple Deed

Oliver Guo and his wife, Amanda, started "The Simple Deed", a volunteer network that makes and distributes fabric masks with a transparent window. They realised that those who rely on lip reading or sign language to communicate and learn, such as the Deaf or the Hard-of-hearing community, often face communication challenges during these times when people are wearing masks.
<br><br>They started by learning how to sew from their mum, thereafter sourced for materials from local tailoring companies and expanded their volunteer base to increase production. They would deliver the mask kits to volunteers and collect them back for donation to SADeaf.

<sup><b><u>About</u></b><br>A simple deed a day - here to give back by doing our bit to contribute to the greater community and hoping to inspire more to do the same in their own capacity.<br><br>For more information about The Simple Deed, <a href="https://linktr.ee/thesimpledeed" style="color:tomato">click here.</a></sup>
