![WIMBY](/images/WIMBY.png)

WIMBY aims to pre-empt tensions caused by the rehousing effort and counter NIMBYism by amplifying the message that MWs are Welcome In My Backyard, or WIMBY. Our mission is to mobilise all of society to create a safe space for MWs within their local neighbourhoods, with the wider goal of normalising relations between MWs and Singaporeans.

Initiatives: 
* Collect and consolidate welcome notes and messages of encouragement that will be translated and distributed to our migrant worker friends.
* Conducting virtual dialogue sessions to connect local residents, advocates from well-established non-profits for MWs, and healthcare professionals - covering topics such as residentsâ€™ concerns and debunk common myths and misconceptions about MWs.
* Appoint ambassadors who live in relevant communities to help debunk racist stereotypes and reframe degrading narratives about our MWs
