## About Share the Moment

A joint initiative with Community Partner, National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre (NVPC), the Share the Moment campaign is a community engagement project that showcases original artworks on two iconic facades in Marina Bay – The Fullerton Hotel Singapore and the Merlion. 

This edition of Share the Moment is inspired by the stories of this year’s President’s Volunteerism & Philanthropy Awards nominees, where local students co-create works of art inspired by these stories of good. The artworks were then adapted for the projection mapping shows that will light up the Marina Bay precinct. 

From 26 to 31 December 2022, be enthralled by these nightly projection shows, which celebrate acts of giving both big and small, and depict a vision of Singapore where individuals, organisations and leaders come together to give their best for others.
