A joint initiative with Community Partner, the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre, the Share the Moment campaign is a community engagement project that showcases original artworks through light projection shows on two iconic facades in Marina Bay – The Fullerton Hotel Singapore and the Merlion. 

This edition of Share the Moment has the theme of “City of Good”. The 14 original artworks
are created by students from 6 local educational institutions who were inspired by stories of this year’s President’s Volunteerism & Philanthropy Awards nominees. They depict a vision of
Singapore where individuals, organisations and leaders come together to give their best for
others. The artworks have been adapted for the projection mapping shows that will light up the Marina Bay precinct. 

From 26 to 31 December 2022, be enthralled by these nightly projection shows, which celebrate acts of giving both big and small and aim to inspire everyone to continue giving
their best for others and communities in need.
