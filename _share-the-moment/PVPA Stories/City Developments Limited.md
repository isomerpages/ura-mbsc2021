City Developments Limited (CDL) recognises the importance of making corporate social responsibility an integral part of their business. CDL firmly believes that corporate giving goes beyond philanthropy. They are committed to improving society and the environment through extensive public, private and people collaborations to influence positive climate ambitions and action towards a 1.5 degree warmer scenario, while at the same time enhancing lives.

Incorporating sustainability in their business and operations across their entire value chain, CDL adopts a holistic three-pronged approach that includes designing and developing sustainable and green buildings, managing buildings in an energy and resource-efficient way, and engaging and influencing stakeholders to support CDL’s commitment towards sustainable development. For over two decades, CDL adopted an Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) integration strategy that is guided by four pillars – Integration, Innovation, Investment, and Impact. The ESG strategy is integrated into CDL’s core operations and driven across all departments by CDL’s Chief Sustainability Officer, with functional oversight by Senior Management.

In the future, CDL will continue to accelerate their longstanding engagement and advocacy efforts that reach out to a wide-ranging ecosystem comprising stakeholders from the Government, private sector, start-ups and NGOs.
