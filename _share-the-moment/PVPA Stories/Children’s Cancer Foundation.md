Founded in 1992, Children’s Cancer Foundation (CCF) is a social service agency with a mission to improve the quality of life of children with cancer and their families by enhancing their emotional, social and medical well-being. This year, CCF celebrates their 30th anniversary in supporting more than 3,500 families and children affected by cancer.

CCF’s psychosocial programmes and services, such as counselling, therapeutic programmes and social gatherings, are accessible to children and youths at every stage of their cancer journey. Together with the community, CCF continues to provide quality services towards supporting their beneficiaries affected by childhood cancer.
