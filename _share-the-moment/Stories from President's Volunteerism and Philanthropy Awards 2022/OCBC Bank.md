OCBC Bank is the longest established Singapore bank, formed in 1932 by the merger of three local banks, the oldest of which was founded in 1912. It is now the second largest financial services group in Southeast Asia by assets and one of the world’s most highly rated banks, with Aa1 by Moody’s and AA- by both Fitch and S&P. Recognised for its financial strength and stability, OCBC Bank is consistently ranked among the World’s Top 50 Safest Banks by Global Finance and has been named Best Managed Bank in Singapore by The Asian Banker. OCBC Bank operates in four key markets: Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Greater China.

The #OCBCCares Programme addresses gaps and offers sustainable support to segments of the community that are underserved, including at-risk children, youths and families; vulnerable seniors; people with special needs. The programme also actively supports initiatives that benefit the environment.

The #OCBCCares programme focuses on providing targeted support, where there are gaps. In 2022, the gaps identified are mental wellness and food security for low-income families. OCBC will be working with a charity partner to leverage social media to reach out to at-risk youths, to teach them healthy coping techniques. They are also in talks with them to design a dedicated mental wellness programme to help youths build resilience against stressors that might lead to a deterioration in mental health. As for food security, OCBC is looking at working with a number of their charity partners to support food security such as ensuring that needy families can have regular access to nutritious food. This could involve scaling up existing programmes or providing new sources of food supplies.
