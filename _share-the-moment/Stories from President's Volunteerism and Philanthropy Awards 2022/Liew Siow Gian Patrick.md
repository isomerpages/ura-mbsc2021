Patrick has devoted a large part of his life to helping the least, the lonely and the lost. He currently volunteers to help lead and manage the following organisations: Junior Achievement Singapore, Worldwide Transformation, Singapore Gymnastics, Singapore National Olympic Council, Anderson Secondary School, Responsible Gambling Forum, Citizensâ€™ Consultative Committee, SG Serve, Wrestling Federation of Singapore.

Patrick also helped to organise a Mental Wellness Summit in 2021 to encourage people in Singapore to look after their mental and emotional well-being. During the pandemic, Patrick also led a project to deliver care packages to families of healthcare workers as appreciation for their efforts and contributions. Patrick also produced a video in Hakka that was partially used by Channel News Asia to encourage the Hakka elderly to protect themselves during the pandemic and be vaccinated. He did it because most educational videos targeted at the elderly were produced in national languages and major Chinese dialects but not in Hakka.

As Chairman of GEX Ventures Pte Ltd, Patrick continues to commit 10% of net profits to worthwhile causes. He also continues to empower his colleagues to manage giving-back efforts and initiate new activities.
