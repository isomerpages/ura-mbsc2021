Since 2011, the North Division Girl Guides (NDGG) has been partnering with Sree Narayana Mission (Singapore) (SNM), to bring programmes and activities facilitated by the Girl Guides from over 20 schools under NDGG to the residents of SNM Nursing Home.

Every year, about 30 groups of ten to fifteen Girl Guides visit SNM (physically or virtually) from March to December, to facilitate and conduct intergenerational programmes consisting of art and craft workshops; song, dance and music performances; interactive table games; online games; and physical exercises with our residents at SNM Nursing Home. More than 180 intergenerational engagements have been held by NDGG for SNM's residents over the past 11 years. NDGG plans to continue sending about 30 groups of Girl Guides from 22 schools under NDGG to participate annually.
