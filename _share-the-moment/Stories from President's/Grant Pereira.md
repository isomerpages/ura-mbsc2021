Grant has been a passionate and influential advocate for environmental matters over the last 40 years. His involvement in environmental initiatives cuts across both local and international efforts. Despite the pandemic putting a halt to almost all of Grantâ€™s community and conservation projects in Southeast Asian countries, he continued with volunteers in the Green Volunteers, and educating others about natural conservation in Singapore.

He spends his time volunteering at the Butterfly Gardens in Tampines and Pasir Ris, where he has an active nursery for anyone keen to grow their own plants, and also works with the Singapore Botanic Gardens to grow butterfly plants in the Jacob Ballas Garden. He has worked with the National Heritage Board in a video at the first online Singapore Heritage Festival, advocating for green living and initiatives, partnered with Our Better World (an initiative under Singapore International Foundation) to share about the good that volunteering has for our society and is now working with NParks on the One Million Trees project.
