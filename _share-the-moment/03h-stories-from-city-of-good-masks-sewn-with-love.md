## Masks Sewn with Love

Masks Sewn with Love is a community project to sew reusable cloth masks for the community by the community (of volunteers) and these masks are then distributed free to the vulnerable groups in shelters and homes; cleaners and domestic helpers; and vulnerable kids and their families. We have also shared these masks sewn with love to our frontline heroes in recognition of their dedicated service during this challenging period.<br><br>This initiative is in collaboration with the Peopleâ€™s Association Women's Integration Network Council and the Centre for Domestic Employees.
