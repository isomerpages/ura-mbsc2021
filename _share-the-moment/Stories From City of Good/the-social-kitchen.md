## Abhishek Bajaj

Abishek Bajaj is the co-founder of 6th Sense, a volunteer-run, ground-up initiative that has been serving children living at the Public Rental Scheme flats of Kebun Baru since 2019. 

At 6th Sense, we believe in seeing each person develop holistically, living a life of purpose, balance and meaning. Our focus is on playing an enabling role in the community, for the children to achieve their goals and dreams. The team conducts fortnightly Saturday evening sessions, creating art that is often inspired by nature or building upon the child's inspiration. We further immerse ourselves in free play around the HDB blocks, playing block catching, or visiting parks such as the Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park.
