The Great World Carnival by Uncle Ringo pays homage to the historic Great World Amusement Park, offering a nostalgic glimpse into Singapore’s leisure scene in the 1920s to 1970s. The carnival games are replete with mega-sized plushies to win, and visitors can expect classic rides such as the Ringo Slide, Big Carousel, and Water Boat. Adding a contemporary touch will be an experiential inflatable playland based on OpenSea’s Prime Ape Planet. Tickets are now on sale for $10 (inclusive of $5 carnival credits).

**Opening hours:**
