The Great Bay Fiesta will be open daily at the Bayfront Event Space from 1 December 2022 to 1 January 2023. Presented by Trip.com, this exciting entertainment concept by The Show Master (a new blockbuster entertainment arm by Uncle Ringo) will feature a diverse line up of merrymaking activities with four main highlights – The Great Cirque de Cascades, Ice Magic: The Great Fantasy on Ice, The Great World Carnival by Uncle Ringo, and The Great Food Fiesta.

### The Great Cirque des Cascades

The Great Cirque des Cascades is a showcase of international circus stunts and acts – many of which will be making their debut in Singapore – set to thrill audiences. The line up by Gandey’s Circus is aptly named Around The World in 80 Minutes, curated under one of the biggest Big Top tents to grace Marina Bay with 1,000 seats. Audiences can expect a breathtaking journey filled with laughter, excitement, glitz and glamour. Tickets are now on sale, ranging from $72 to $148.

### Ice Magic: The Great Fantasy on Ice

Ice Magic: The Great Fantasy on Ice will be the biggest pop-up winter-themed attraction to set foot in sunny Singapore. Also in a Big Top tent, this magical wonderland will transport visitors from the heat of our tropical island to a snowy world for a special indoor ice and snow experience, including snow slopes, ice slides and sculptures, and winter sports, coupled with dessert and drink bars. Tickets are now on sale, ranging from $25 to $45.

### The Great World Carnival by Uncle Ringo

The Great World Carnival by Uncle Ringo will pay homage to the historic Great World Amusement Park, offering a nostalgic glimpse into Singapore’s leisure scene in the 1920s to 1970s. The carnival games will be replete with mega-sized plushies to win, and visitors can expect classic rides such as the Ringo Slide, Big Carousel, and Water Boat. Adding a contemporary touch will be an experiential inflatable playland based on OpenSea’s Prime Ape Planet. Tickets are now on sale for $10 (inclusive of $5 carnival credits).

### The Great Food Fiesta

No trip to the carnival is complete without festive bites and fairground treats. Visitors may dig into a delightful selection of specialty fare from over 30 stalls with unique offerings, some of which will be specially flown in from overseas. Admission to The Great Food Fiesta is free.
