Presented in collaboration with local philanthropic organisation The Majurity Trust,
Brightening Lives 2023 features light installations such as fairy light tunnels and trees
festooned with meteor drip lights that are perfect for Instagram shots. These light

installations are on display nightly until the end of the year.
