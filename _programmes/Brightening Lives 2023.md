## About Brightening Lives 2023 

Presented in collaboration with local philanthropic organisation The Majurity Trust, Brightening
Lives 2023 features light installations such as fairy light tunnels and trees festooned with
meteor drip lights that are perfect for Instagram shots. These light installations aim to add
festive cheer to the Bay, and also signify our collective commitment to offer time and resources
to better the lives of people around us who are in need.
The light installations will be on display nightly from 19 to 31 December along the waterfront
promenade adjacent to Marina Boulevard.
