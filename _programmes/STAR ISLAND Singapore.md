### STAR ISLAND @ The Float

STAR ISLAND Singapore is coming back after a two-year hiatus on 31 December 2022, with a 22,000 seating capacity at The Float. Presented by JCB, STAR ISLAND is a 70-minute _hanabi_ (fireworks) musical extravaganza combining artisanal fireworks, larger-than-life pyrotechnics and dazzling lights, immersive sound and world-class entertainment.

This year’s show will feature the Singapore debut of specially designed and award-winning fireworks, including ombre fireworks whose colours change as they bloom in Singapore’s stunning colours, from red to white. In addition to the main show, ticketholders can enjoy pre-show entertainment, family-friendly activities and play areas, F&B offerings, and more at The Float. These will feature beloved Sanrio characters such as Hello Kitty and Gudetama.

### Prequel to STAR ISLAND @ MBS Event Plaza

For the first time, STAR ISLAND will also be hosting a free-admission event preview at the MBS Event Plaza from 25 to 30 December 2022. At the Prequel to STAR ISLAND, visitors can look forward to a Sanrio-themed bazaar and family-friendly activities, F&B pop-ups, and recaps of previous STAR ISLAND shows.

### Ticketing Information
