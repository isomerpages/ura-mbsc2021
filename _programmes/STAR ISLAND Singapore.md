Tickets are now on sale, ranging from $25 to $45.

### The Great World Carnival by Uncle Ringo

The Great World Carnival by Uncle Ringo will pay homage to the historic Great World Amusement Park, offering a nostalgic glimpse into Singapore’s leisure scene in the 1920s to 1970s. The carnival games will be replete with mega-sized plushies to win, and visitors can expect classic rides such as the Ringo Slide, Big Carousel, and Water Boat.
