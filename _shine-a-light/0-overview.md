# Overview

60 powerful light beams light up the night sky above The Promontory for Shine A Light. Replacing the traditional fireworks, these light beams serve as a guiding beacon and energising reminder for everyone to focus on the positives in the face of adversity. 

Each night, the light beams will animate in choreographed patterns.

The Shine A Light shows will take place every night from 1 to 31 December 2020. Refer to the schedule for more details.
