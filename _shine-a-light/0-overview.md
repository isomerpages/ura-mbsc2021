# Overview

A feast for the eyes, public can expect to be awed by Shine A Light, a simplistic yet iconic animated light display featuring 60 vibrant light beams at The Promontory. 

Replacing the traditional fireworks, these light beams are projected into the skies to serve as an empowering reminder for everyone to focus on the positives in face of adversities. Like a beacon of light that guides the way, the animations of Shine A Light are intricately designed to represent unity, positivity and resilience as we welcome a brand new start to the new year with fervour. 

The Shine A Light display will be presented on a nightly basis at regular intervals between 8pm to 10.30pm from 1st to 31st December 2020.
