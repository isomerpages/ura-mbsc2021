# Overview

[SAL](/images/O1.jpg "Shine a Light")

Representing hopes of a new beginning, Shine a Light comprises 60 light beams projecting from The Promontory, illuminating the Marina Bay skyline nightly from 1 December to 31 December 2020. Arranged in a circle, the 60 light beams form the notches of a clockface as we count down to the New Year. With a collective formation of light rays projected into the sky – designed to symbolise unity, positivity and resilience – the display represents a guiding beacon that underpins Singaporeans’ spirit in navigating through the pandemic and determination to emerge stronger in the new year as a nation.
