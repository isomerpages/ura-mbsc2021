# Overview

60 powerful light beams light up the night sky above The Promontory for Shine A Light. Replacing the traditional fireworks, these light beams serve as a guiding beacon and energising reminder for everyone to focus on the positives in the face of adversity. 

Shine A Light is one of the highlights of Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2021 that gives hope, provides direction, and guides everyone to a better future. Shine A Light is more than just a singular beacon of light. It is a collective, formed from the fusion of positive energy garnered from all around.

The light beams are positioned in a circular setting to represent the face of a clock, or a timepiece. The beacon symbolises the passage of time where our heartfelt hopes and wishes gathered throughout the year collectively transforms into infinite possibilities of goodness that will welcome the new year on a bright start. 

Each night, the light beams will animate in choreographed patterns. Shine A Light will transform over the entire month of December and it will also be instrumental during the final minutes counting down to the new year.

The Shine A Light shows will take place every night from 1 to 31 December 2020. Refer to the schedule for more details.
