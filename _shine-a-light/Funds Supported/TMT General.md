# TMT General

The TMT General Fund helps causes that work towards building thriving communities in Singapore, and whose work falls outside the criteria for the other Funds. 

Specifically, the TMT General Fund supports innovative initiatives and charities that meet emerging needs. To date, the fund covers a diverse range of causes, from crowdfunding charity Ray of Hope, to leadership development in the social sector with the NCSS 40-Under40 programme, and helping to scale volunteer-run better.sg, which develops innovative digital tools to address societal challenges.
