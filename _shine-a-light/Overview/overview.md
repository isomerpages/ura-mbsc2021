![SAL](/images/overview.jpeg "Shine a Light")

The Shine a Light display, which made its debut at last year’s MBSC, will return with 60 light beams in a circular formation to be projected from The Promontory. These represent strength in diversity as we rally around one another to navigate the pandemic, and shine the spotlight on frontline workers, ground-up groups, as well as charities meeting needs within our communities during these difficult times.  

This year, local philanthropic organisation The Majurity Trust has come on board as the community partner for Shine a Light. In conjunction with the light display, The Majurity Trust has embarked on a fundraising campaign to rally donors, corporates and private individuals, to ‘adopt’ 60 light beams to symbolically brighten up the lives of those amongst us who are in need. The funds raised will go towards five grants that support various vulnerable communities in Singapore, such as youths struggling with mental health issues, people living with dementia and their caregivers, and at-risk families. 

Shine a Light will be launched on 1 December. Each week from 1 to 28 December, Shine a Light will light up in a different colour to spotlight a different cause. From 29 to 31 December, the display will light up in magenta to represent the harmonious spirit of Singapore Together, and celebrate the partnerships forged between Singaporeans to create a caring, just and equal Singapore with opportunities for all.
