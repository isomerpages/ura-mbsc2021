# Funds Supported through the Shine a Light Campaign

### Singapore Strong
The Singapore Strong fund (SG Strong) was launched in mid-February 2020 to encourage and empower people to step up to do more in difficult times. The fund supports and catalyzes ground-up initiatives to address community needs arising from COVID-19. More than 200,000 beneficiaries were helped by 170 ground-up groups and charities supported by SG Strong. 

The work of SG Strong grantees can be found on: majurity.sg/sgstrong-directory
 
### Silver is Gold
The Silver is Gold (SIG) fund aims to help the elderly in Singapore thrive, especially for those living with dementia. SIG funds innovative and effective programmes to address the challenges that dementia poses. This includes help for individuals with dementia, support for their caregivers, as well as creating awareness and understanding of dementia in the wider community.
 
Musim Mas BlueStar*
The Musim Mas BlueStar* Fund is a million-dollar fund seeded by a corporate philanthropist to support non-profit organisations that deliver effective and innovative mental health initiatives for children and youth suffering from depression and anxiety. The fund aims to seed new ideas and approaches that include preventive mental health intervention, research and public education initiatives reaching out to youth, and their parents and peers.
 
### Scaffold
The Scaffold Fund aims to support ground-up initiatives that promote stronger community bonds between locals and migrant workers, as well as address the needs of domestic workers or low-wage migrant workers from various sectors. Its goal is to build a more inclusive and gracious Singapore for our migrant workers.
 
### TMT General
The TMT General Fund helps causes that work towards building thriving communities in Singapore, and whose work falls outside the criteria for the other Funds. 

Specifically, the TMT General Fund supports innovative initiatives and charities that meet emerging needs. To date, the fund covers a diverse range of causes, from crowdfunding charity Ray of Hope, to leadership development in the social sector with the NCSS 40-Under40 programme, and helping to scale volunteer-run better.sg, which develops innovative digital tools to address societal challenges.
