# Scaffold
The Scaffold Fund aims to support ground-up initiatives that promote stronger community bonds between locals and migrant workers, as well as address the needs of domestic workers or low-wage migrant workers from various sectors. Its goal is to build a more inclusive and gracious Singapore for our migrant workers.
