# Singapore Strong

The Singapore Strong fund (SG Strong) was launched in mid-February 2020 to encourage and empower people to step up to do more in difficult times. The fund supports and catalyzes ground-up initiatives to address community needs arising from COVID-19. More than 200,000 beneficiaries were helped by 170 ground-up groups and charities supported by SG Strong.
