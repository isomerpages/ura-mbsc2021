# Community Partner - The Majurity Trust

The Majurity Trust is a philanthropic organisation, recognised as an Institution of Public Character (IPC) in Singapore. The Majurity Trust seeks to work with donors and charities to build a thriving and sustainable community for all in Singapore.
 
For the month of December, in conjunction with the Shine a Light display, The Majurity Trust aims to shine the spotlight on pressing social issues and the everyday heroes meeting the needs of different communities in Singapore. Alongside the light display, The Majurity Trust has embarked on a fundraising campaign to rally donors, corporates and private individuals to ‘adopt’ 60 light beams. 

Funds raised through Shine a Light will go towards five grants which support the following communities: frontline workers, at-risk families affected by COVID-19, people living with dementia, youth struggling with mental health, migrant workers and emerging needs.
