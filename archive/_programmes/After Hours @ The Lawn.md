After Hours @ The Lawn, set on the grassy expanse right outside Downtown MRT, will be the right choice for those looking to experience the celebrations with a more laid-back ambience. Organised in partnership with the Marina Bay Alliance (a pilot Business Improvement District for the precinct), this two-day lifestyle event will take place on 30 and 31 December, and is suitable for different age groups, from the young to the wise.

After Hours @ The Lawn features larger-than-life games and playsets, as well as live performances. Team up with your friends and family to participate in friendly matches! Get ready your picnic mats at the chill-out zone with a good view of both the entertainment on stage and the fireworks across the Bay on New Yearâ€™s Eve. To top off your experience, satisfy your appetite with delectable offerings from the F&B bazaar!
