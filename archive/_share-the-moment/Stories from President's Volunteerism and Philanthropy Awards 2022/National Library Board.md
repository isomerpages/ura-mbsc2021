The National Library Board (NLB) nurtures Readers for Life, Learning Communities and a Knowledgeable Nation by promoting reading, learning and history through its network of 28 libraries, the National Library and the National Archives of Singapore. NLB also forges strategic partnerships that encourage awareness, appreciation and greater discovery of Singapore’s history through its rich collections in Singapore and the region.

NLB achieves excellence through innovation, focusing on citizen engagement and co-creation, resource and digital innovation. This creates learning opportunities, greater access to library resources, services, and archival collections, as well as a continual development of innovative library spaces. Established on 1 September 1995 as a statutory board, NLB is under the Ministry of Communications and Information.

The community is at the heart of what NLB does. As part of NLB’s LAB25 (Libraries and Archives Blueprint 2025) Equaliser role, NLB works with its partners, volunteers, and the community to empower everyone with more resources and opportunities to read, learn and discover. From community initiatives such as kidsREAD to WondeREAD, Early Read, MOLLY (Mobile Library) and The Little Book Box, NLB provides additional support and resources to meet the needs of  communities with less access to and more challenges in reading and learning.
