# Overview

A joint initiative with Community Partner, National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre (NVPC), Share the Moment campaign anchors the community engagement element of MBSC 2021, by which it is also one of the two key cornerstones of this yearâ€™s programme.

Witness stories come to life on iconic facades around the Marina Bay inspired from the network of good deeds contributed by the community!

This edition of Share the Moment features diversified experiences and stories featured by NVPC, wherein these stories collectively paint a vision of a Singapore that cares, where individuals, organisations and leaders come together to give their best for others in a City of Good. This joint initiative is made possible through the close collaboration from dedicated students of local institutions who volunteered their time to participate in a series of masterclasses to co-create works of art inspired from these stories of good. 
						
Through these curated video projection shows, we hope to inspire the community to appreciate the gift of time, be inspired by the stories, and continue nurture the spirit of good for the upcoming year ahead.

The projection mapping shows will be aired from the 25th December 2020, leading up to New Year's Eve.
