# Marina Bay Singapore Countdown

Since its inception in 2005, the Marina Bay Singapore Countdown (MBSC) has become the nation’s largest and most spectacular New Year’s Eve Celebration. 
Proudly presented by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), Singapore’s annual iconic New Year’s Eve celebration allows everyone to enjoy the unique cityscape and vibrant atmosphere as we usher in the New Year. 

This year, Singapore’s highly anticipated year-end celebrations, MBSC 2021, brings forth a uniquely different experience for the public to enjoy virtually at the comfort of their own homes. MBSC 2021 presents an avenue that garners people across borders and from all walks of life to reflect on 2020 and to celebrate our hopes and aspirations for 2021 in unity.

This edition of MBSC 2021 will feature two key captivating highlights: Shine A Light, Singapore’s first-ever countdown light animations replacing the traditional countdown fireworks; as well as Share the Moment, a showcase of video projections featured on iconic facades by the Marina Bay with enthralling storytelling elements inspired from good deeds by the community.
