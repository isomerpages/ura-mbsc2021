# Marina Bay Singapore Countdown

Proudly presented by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), Marina Bay Singapore Countdown – Singapore’s iconic New Year’s Eve celebration – allows everyone to enjoy the unique cityscape and vibrant atmosphere as we usher in the New Year. 

This year, MBSC 2021 takes on a different format to bring people together to reflect on 2020 and to celebrate our hopes and aspirations for the coming year. 

MBSC 2021 will feature two main highlights: Shine a Light, a light display, as well as Share the Moment, a showcase of co-created art, transformed by projection mapping onto iconic facades in Marina Bay – The Fullerton Hotel Singapore, ArtScience Museum and the Merlion.
