# Marina Bay Singapore Countdown

Proudly presented by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), the Marina Bay Singapore Countdown (MBSC) – Singapore’s iconic New Year’s Eve celebration – will usher in a brighter 2022 come this December. Feast your eyes as Marina Bay is illuminated by vibrant light beams and projections to uplift our spirits and welcome the New Year.
 
This year, MBSC 2022 will feature two key highlights: Shine a Light, an inspirational light display, and Share the Moment, a visual storytelling showcase. To add to the festive cheer, part of the Marina Bay waterfront promenade alongside Marina Boulevard will also be lit up with special light installations and projections. 

There will be no fireworks at Marina Bay on New Year’s Eve to prevent large crowds from gathering in the precinct, and to mitigate the risk of transmission of COVID-19.

MBSC 2022 is in support of the Singapore Together movement, where Singaporeans work in partnership with one another, and with the Government, to achieve our vision of a caring, just and equal society.
