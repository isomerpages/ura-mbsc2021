## Marina Bay Singapore Countdown

Into its 18th edition in 2022, the Marina Bay Singapore Countdown (MBSC) remains the largest and most iconic countdown celebration in Singapore. Proudly presented by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), MBSC allows everyone to enjoy the unique cityscape and vibrant atmosphere as we welcome the New Year together.

This year-end, crowd-favourite fireworks will return to illuminate the Marina Bay skyline as part of Singapore’s biggest countdown event, Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2023. With an exciting lineup of activities, this year’s Countdown will bring back an immersive and fun-filled experience for revellers, as Singapore ushers in a new year with renewed hope and exuberance.
