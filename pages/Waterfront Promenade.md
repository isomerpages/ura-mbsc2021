## Waterfront Promenade

To add to the festive cheer, part of the Marina Bay waterfront promenade adjacent to Marina Boulevard will also be lit up with special light installations and projections. Each embodying the spirit of creativity and hopefulness, the installations aim to offer visitors an uplifting experience as they walk through a kaleidoscope of colours on a treetop canopy, immerse themselves in a galaxy of stars, pose with an installation comprising lighted inflatable bird structures, or contemplate an abstract clockface projection display. 

The waterfront promenade light installations will be on display nightly from 1 to 31 December 2021, 8pm to 10.30pm, with extended display times on 31 December.
