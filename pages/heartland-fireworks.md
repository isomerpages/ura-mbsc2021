<p style="text-align:center;">As safety remains a priority in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, there will be <b>no fireworks display at Marina Bay</b> on 31 December 2020 to minimise crowds from gathering in the precinct. Instead, fireworks will be set off from different heartland locations across Singapore, bringing the Countdown experience closer to Singaporeans at home. Stay tuned for further details.</p>
