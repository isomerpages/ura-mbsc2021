As safety remains a priority in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, there will be **no fireworks display at Marina Bay** on 31 December 2020 to minimise crowds from gathering in the precinct. Instead, fireworks will be set off from different heartland locations across Singapore, bringing the Countdown experience closer to Singaporeans at home. 

The different heartland locations are:

1. Bedok
2. Bishan
3. Boon Lay
4. Geylang
5. Hougang 
6. Jurong
7. Nanyang
8. Tampines
9. Tiong Bahru
10. Woodlands 
11. Yew Tee
