#### What is the Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2021?

Since its inception in 2005, the Marina Bay Singapore Countdown (MBSC) has become the nation’s largest and most spectacular New Year’s Eve Celebration.

Proudly presented by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), Singapore’s annual New Year’s Eve celebration allows everyone to enjoy the unique cityscape and vibrant atmosphere as we usher in the New Year.

This year, Singapore’s iconic countdown event, MBSC 2021, takes on a unique format to bring people together to reflect on 2020 and to celebrate our hopes and aspirations for the coming year.

MBSC 2021 will feature two main highlights: Shine a Light, a choreographed light display, as well as Share the Moment, a showcase of co-created art, transformed by projection mapping onto iconic facades in Marina Bay – The Fullerton Hotel Singapore, ArtScience Museum and the Merlion.

#### Will there be fireworks happening this year at the Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2021?

As safety remains a priority in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, there will be **no fireworks display at Marina Bay** on 31 December 2020 to minimise crowds from gathering in the precinct. Instead, fireworks will be set off from different heartland locations across Singapore, bringing the Countdown experience closer to Singaporeans at home. Stay tuned for further details. 

#### Will there be any programmes for Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2021?

As part of Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2021, the public can expect to view Shine a Light, the light display at The Promontory from 1 to 31 December 2020, and Share the Moment video mapping projection shows on the facades of The Fullerton Hotel Singapore, ArtScience Museum and the Merlion from 25 to 31 December 2020.

The public is encouraged to experience these highlights at their own time and convenience prior to New Year’s Eve.
