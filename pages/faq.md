#### What is the Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2022?
Proudly presented by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), the Marina Bay Singapore Countdown (MBSC) – Singapore’s iconic New Year’s Eve celebration – will usher in a brighter 2022 come this December. Feast your eyes as Marina Bay is illuminated by vibrant light beams and projections to uplift our spirits and welcome the New Year.
 
MBSC 2022 will feature two key highlights: Shine a Light, an inspirational light display, and Share the Moment, a visual storytelling showcase on The Fullerton Hotel Singapore, ArtScience Museum and the Merlion. To add to the festive cheer, part of the Marina Bay waterfront promenade alongside Marina Boulevard will also be lit up with special light installations and projections. 


#### Will there be fireworks happening this year at the Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2022?
As safety remains a priority in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, there will be no fireworks display at Marina Bay on 31 December 2021 to minimise crowds from gathering in the precinct. Instead, fireworks will be set off from different heartland locations across Singapore, bringing the Countdown experience closer to Singaporeans at home.
