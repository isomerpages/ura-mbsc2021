#### What is the Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2021?

Since its inception in 2005, the Marina Bay Singapore Countdown (MBSC) has become the nation’s largest and most spectacular New Year’s Eve Celebration. 

Proudly presented by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), Singapore’s annual iconic New Year’s Eve celebration allows everyone to enjoy the unique cityscape and vibrant atmosphere as we usher in the New Year. 

This year, Singapore’s highly anticipated year-end celebrations, MBSC 2021, brings forth a uniquely different experience for the public to enjoy virtually at the comfort of their own homes. MBSC 2021 presents an avenue that garners people across borders and from all walks of life to reflect on 2020 and to celebrate our hopes and aspirations for 2021 in unity.

#### Will there be fireworks happening this year at the Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2021?

With the emphasis of public safety as priority, there will not be fireworks happening this year at the Marina Bay, in deliberate consideration to prevent large crowds and gathering of the masses. In place of the traditional fireworks would be a symbolic light display by Shine A Light, to meaningfully mark the transition into the new year. 

#### What are the programmes for Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2021?

As part of Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2021, the public can expect to view Shine A Light, the light display at The Promontory from 1st to 31st December 2020 and Share the Moment, the video mapping projection display on the facades of The Fullerton Hotel, ArtScience Museum and the Merlion.
