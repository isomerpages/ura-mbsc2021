5.1 URA may provide facilities on the Site to permit you to submit any contribution (including but not limited to any text, graphics, video and/or audio content, and other materials or information) (“Submissions”) to URA or to the Site directly. You are solely responsible for your own Submissions, and URA only acts as a passive conduit for the online distribution and publication of your Submissions.

5.2 By submitting your Submissions, you agree as follows:

you will not include any content in your Submissions that is or could be unlawful, defamatory, offensive, obscene, dangerous or false, or any content that is protected by copyright or other intellectual property right, without first obtaining permission of the copyright owner or rights-holder, or any content that contains any viruses, bugs or other harmful elements; you hereby grant to URA a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive right, sub-licensable right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate and distribute such material (in whole or in part) worldwide and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media or technology now known or hereafter developed for the full term of any copyright that may exist in such material for any purpose. You will not assume a false identity or the identity of another user when using the Site, and you will not use the Site for any unlawful or illegal activities, including but not limited to spamming, harassing or otherwise causing distress to other users.

5.3 URA shall have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor the Submissions contributed to the Site, including but not limited to photos, videos, sms and text wishes submitted. URA shall have the right to remove or delete any material that URA, in its sole discretion, finds to be in violation of these terms or otherwise objectionable or inappropriate without having to assign any reason therefore. In addition, URA shall have the right to terminate your use of the Site if it believes that you have violated these terms or for any other reason whatsoever, without notice to you.

5.4 If you submit or provide any personally identifiable information through the Site, you acknowledge and consent to URA collecting and using such information for various purposes, including without limitation, verification and record of your personal particulars, comparing it with information from other sources, to communicate with you and/or to send you information and promotional material about URA or third party organisations selected by us.

For the above purposes by third parties (who may be based outside Singapore) who offer goods and services or sponsor contests or other promotional programs on our site, whether in conjunction with us or not, if you purchase such goods, use such services or participate in such contests and promotional programs.

6 INDEMNITIES

6.1 You agree to defend and hold URA, its affiliates and related corporations from and against all claims, losses, damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees on an indemnity basis, arising out of your use of the Site or any breach of these terms. In addition, URA may use whatever information that is available about you to stop any such breach or any unlawful or inappropriate use of the Site, including informing any third party URA deem appropriate of such breach or use and/or disclosing your personal information to such third party.

7 THIRD PARTY CONTENT

7.1 URA is a distributor (and not a publisher) of content supplied by third parties and Subscribers. Accordingly, URA has no more editorial control over such content than does a public library, bookstore, or newsstand. Any opinions, advice, statements, services, offers, or other information or content expressed or made available by third parties, including information providers, Subscribers or any other user of the site, are those of the respective author(s) or distributor(s) and not of URA. Neither URA nor any third-party provider of information guarantees the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any content, nor its merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose.

In many instances, the content available through the site represents the opinions and judgments of the respective information provider, Subscriber, or other user not under contract with URA. URA neither endorses nor is responsible for the accuracy or reliability of any opinion, advice or statement made on the site. Under no circumstances will URA and its partners be liable for any loss or damage caused by a Subscriber’s reliance on information obtained through the Site. It is the responsibility of Subscriber to evaluate the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any information, opinion, advice or other content available through the Site. Please seek the advice of professionals, as appropriate, regarding the evaluation of any specific information, opinion, advice or other content.

8 SEVERABILITY

8.1 If any of these terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such term shall be struck out and the remaining terms shall be enforced. Any failure to act by URA with respect to any breach by you or others of any of the provisions of these terms and conditions does not waive URA’s right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.

9 NOTICE

9.1 You hereby agree and acknowledge:

that all electronic communications made pursuant to the use of this Site shall be given legal effect, validity and enforceability and shall have, between the parties thereto, comparable evidential value to that accorded to a signed written document; not to contest the legally binding nature, validity or enforceability of any transaction on the Site on the ground that it was entered into electronically.

10 GOVERNING LAWS

10.1 These terms shall be governed by Singapore laws and any dispute arising out of the use of the Site shall be referred to the Singapore courts.
