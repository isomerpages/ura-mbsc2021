      description: "A joint initiative with Community Partner, National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre (NVPC), the Share the Moment campaign is a community engagement project that showcases original artworks on iconic facades in Marina Bay, co-created by local students who were inspired by the stories of this year’s President’s Volunteerism & Philanthropy Awards nominees. These projection shows portray heartwarming moments where people have come together to give their best for others in difficult times and to encourage the community to carry forward this spirit of giving in the year ahead."

      title: Light Installations along Marina Bay waterfront promenade
      description: "Four sections of the Marina Bay waterfront promenade will be lit up with special light installations and projections. Each embodying the spirit of creativity and hopefulness, the installations aim to offer visitors an uplifting experience as they walk through a kaleidoscope of colours on a treetop canopy, immerse themselves in a galaxy of stars, pose with an installation comprising lighted inflatable bird structures, or contemplate an abstract clockface projection display. <p> The waterfront promenade light installations will be on display nightly from 1 to 31 December 2021, 8pm to 10.30pm, with extended display times on 31 December."
