      description: A joint initiative with Community Partner, National Volunteer and
        Philanthropy Centre (NVPC), the Share the Moment campaign is a community
        engagement project that showcases co-created artworks through projection
        mapping sequences on iconic facades in Marina Bay. Through these
        projection shows, we hope to celebrate the selflessness and resilience
        of the community, and continue to nurture the spirit of giving in the
        year ahead.
