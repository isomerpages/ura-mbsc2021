      title: Light Installations along Marina Bay waterfront promenade
      description: Four sections of the Marina Bay waterfront promenade will be lit up
        with special light installations and projections. Each embodying the
        spirit of creativity and hopefulness, the installations aim to offer
        visitors an uplifting experience as they walk through a kaleidoscope of
        colours on a treetop canopy, immerse themselves in a galaxy of stars,
        pose with an installation comprising lighted inflatable bird structures,
        or contemplate an abstract clockface projection display. The waterfront
        promenade light installations will be on display nightly from 1 to 31
        December 2021, 8pm to 10.30pm, with extended display times on 31
        December.
