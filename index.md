        description: A joint initiative with Community Partner, National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre (NVPC), the Share the Moment campaign will feature artworks co-created by students from Singapore. Inspired by stories from the City of Good – a vision where individuals, organisations and leaders come together to give their best for others – the projected artworks will depict moments in the past year where outstanding givers came together to uplift others in the community.
