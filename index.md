      title: Share the Moment
      description: A joint initiative with Community Partner, National Volunteer and
        Philanthropy Centre (NVPC), the Share the Moment campaign is a community
        engagement project that showcases original artworks on iconic facades in
        Marina Bay, co-created by local students who were inspired by the
        stories of this year’s President’s Volunteerism & Philanthropy Awards
        nominees. These projection shows portray heartwarming moments where
        people have come together to give their best for others in difficult
        times and to encourage the community to carry forward this spirit of
        giving in the year ahead.

      title: Light Installations along Marina Bay waterfront promenade
      description: Four sections of the Marina Bay waterfront promenade will be lit up
        with special light installations and projections. Each embodying the
        spirit of creativity and hopefulness, the installations aim to offer
        visitors an uplifting experience as they walk through a kaleidoscope of
        colours on a treetop canopy, immerse themselves in a galaxy of stars,
        pose with an installation comprising lighted inflatable bird structures,
        or contemplate an abstract clockface projection display. The waterfront
        promenade light installations will be on display nightly from 1 to 31
        December 2021, 8pm to 10.30pm, with extended display times on 31
        December.
